# vue-encryption-game
A game/tool that encrypts and decrypts messages with 3 encrypting and matching decrypting algorithms.  
Created for a Christmas Eve party. 2 of my siblings loved it. 1 of my siblings hated it. The messages which are not allowed to be decrypted are all sections of phrases that got passed out to my siblings. I didn't want them to get by so easily.  

To run the app: 
clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/michael-pollock/vue-encryption-game.git
open the 'Encrypt' folder
open index, and you are good to go. 

If you absolutely hate having a limited number of encryptions per algorithm, just say please.
